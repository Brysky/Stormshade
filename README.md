# Stormshade
My custom stormshade settings based on Nico's https://github.com/Otakumouse/stormshade all credits of creating the shaders
involved goes to him, I simply added 3 new shaders and tweaked the default values of some existing ones to my liking.

These shaders were added in addition to all of stormshade's default lineup
  
    FXAA.fx
    FXAA.fxh
    LumaSharpen.fx
    Vinbrance.fx
    
    
Here are two examples of some effects turned on and off

The first image has default stormshade shaders (with edited values) + Vibrance and FXAA ON

The second image has the default stormshade shaders (with edited values + Vibrance , FXAA , LumaSharpen , Finesharp Mode 1 ON

Just tweak the settings as you like, The first image is more closer to the default stormshade just without the washed out colors.
The second image makes everything looks sharper, which I personally like. But I switch between the two whenever I feel like it.
There are also more images on the images folder so be sure to check them out! I put quite a bit of examples over there~

# How to Install
1. Download everything in the master repository except the images folder
2. Locate where your game is installed (ie. C:\Games\Final Fantasy XIV\SquareEnix\Final Fantasy XIV - A Realm Reborn\game) extract the files within the game folder
3. I recommend removing previous reshade/stormshade installations just to be sure.
4. Login and it should work
5. Open the menu (Default should be Shift + F2) and find my preset there you can customize things as you like.
6. Turn off the Ingame FXAA so the shader one can take over. Everything was taken with Max graphics with FXAA Off.

# Extras
1. You can change the Menu Button as well as toggle effects ON and OFF (My preset has the menu at F11 and Toggle effects at F12)
2. If you want to set the screenshot folder location make a specific place and name for it and type the directory over in the stormshade menu (ie. C:\Games\Stormshade SS) You can also change the screenshot button if you like.
3. Make sure to change the format to PNG as many things do not support the BMP format.
4. Depending on your rig you might lose around 5-15 fps , my rig is very dated now but it still works pretty well on FFXIV
I run a GTX 960 , i5 4430 w/ 16 GB Ram and XIV inside an SSD so if yours is way better you might not even feel any fps loss. I myself lose around 10 depending on the place and how crowded it is.
