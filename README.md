# Stormshade
My custom stormshade settings based on Nico's https://github.com/Otakumouse/stormshade all credits of creating the shaders
involved goes to him, I simply added 3 new shaders and tweaked the default values of some existing ones to my liking.

These shaders were added in addition to all of stormshade's default lineup
  
    FXAA.fx
    FXAA.fxh
    LumaSharpen.fx
    Vinbrance.fx
    
    
Here are two examples of some effects turned on and off

The first image has default stormshade shaders + Vibrance and FXAA ON

Just tweak the settings as you like, The first image is more closer to the default stormshade just without the washed out colors.
The second image makes everything looks sharper, which I personally like. But I switch between the two whenever I feel like it.
