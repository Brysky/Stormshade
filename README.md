# Stormshade
My custom stormshade settings based on Nico's https://github.com/Otakumouse/stormshade all credits of creating the shaders
involved goes to him, I simply added 3 new shaders and tweaked the default values of some existing ones to my liking.

These shaders were added in addition to all of stormshade's default lineup
  
    FXAA.fx
    FXAA.fxh
    LumaSharpen.fx
    Vinbrance.fx
